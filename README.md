# play-count-prediction-with-spotify-data
The project shows the machine learning approaches we took to make prediction on a songâ€™s play count given its audio features, album features and artist features. The data was crawled from Spotify API and the Last.fm API using snowball sampling. After preprocessing the data, we tried several machine learning models, including Linear Regression, SGDRegressor, LinearSVR, Basic Neural Network and Random Forest Regression model. Then we evaluated all the models with Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The methods we used to get the optimal hyper parameters are Grid Search and Randomized Search.
